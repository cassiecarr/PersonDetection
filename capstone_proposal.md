## Proposal

### Domain Background

This machine learning capstone project seeks to identify people in a video stream. 

Resources:



### Problem Statement

This machine learning capstone project seeks to identify people in a video stream.


### Datasets and Inputs

The dataset used for training will be the [INRIA Person Dataset](http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/data/human/). 

### Solution Statement

The solution for this project is a developing a classification algorithm for detecting images of people against images not of people. The algorithm will then be used to search images frames of video to identify people in the video. 

### Benchmark Model

The benchmark models are... 

### Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation metric will be...

### Project Design
